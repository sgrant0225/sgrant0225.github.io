Would it be fair to say software engineering chose me?  Or the other way around? Or perhaps both! 


During my childhood years I was considered the "let me fix this type".  I liked to take many things apart-most of those things belonging to my parents- and put them back together.  Not realizing I made bigger problems, ha!   As I got older, I stopped taking things apart and learned how to create things instead.  I loved fashion, sewing garments and I loved creating cool hairstyles on my sister.  Both of those creative indulgences that I love led to me to becoming a cosmetologist after high school and getting a degree in Fashion Merchandising. During my career, I learned an array of skills, but I mainly enjoyed problem solving, trouble shooting, fixing issues, and mainly creating new things.  


 I learned about web development during summer class while attending an Upward Bound program however, at that time I did not enjoy it.  I rather be creating new hairstyles, sewing patches and splattering paint on my jean jackets or watching new music videos on BET or MTV instead of attending the web development class.  Although, I didn't enjoy my first web development class, I always admired women in movies and TV shows in scenes hacking into a security system or analyzing big data like in shows such as CSI.    Decades later, it's a whole different scenario and perspective. 
 
 Two years ago, while I was attending my company annual meeting, I kept hearing my CEO talk about cool new technical innovations and new projects the dev ops team did.  During that time, I was trying to find my niche and I knew I was ready for another career change.  So, I started googling what people who code does during their day to day. I consumed my free time with watching endless amount of YouTube tutorials, I started buying programming language books, and subscribed to Code Academy and Coursera.  I was so invested in learning that it bought me to where I am today, which is being a bootcamp student at the Flatiron school.  
 
 Being a problem solver, and creator never left me it just landed on a different planet and I'm excited to build and innovate new things on it.  In conclusion, I am super stoked about my journey studying Software Engineering.  I'm ready to tackle this new subject with an open mind, patience, agility and ready to begin my next career as a Software Developer.
