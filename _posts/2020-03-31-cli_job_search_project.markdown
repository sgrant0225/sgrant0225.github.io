My project is focused around Ruby on Rails software developer jobs.  The user can input their city and state and it will display the job information.  During my planning phase I had about six cli ideas however, I struggled with connecting with those ideas and finding the right API for them.  I thought since I'll be looking for jobs in that criteria in the near future, I thought why not stick to the job search cli.

The struggle was real,  creating this project.  My brain left  and went out of town for a few days.  I had no idea how I wanted the logic to flow, what information I wanted to display to the user, I just struggled with what my first line of code should be.  My instructor suggested that I pseudo code it out to help create the logic.  While I puedo coded, I also watched the learn instruct videos and viewed cli project  repositories to help me get started.  It took me about 3 days until I was comfortable with writing my first lines of code.  To back up, it took me some time to understand how to install the gems, creating the environment files and to fully understand how everything connects.  

Once I installed my gems and pulled out the information from my API, I was still confused about how to connect it all.  I then started doing what I was familiar with in OOR and which was creating instance methods, class methods, getter/setter methods.  I can't tell you how many times I used pry before it all connected. I think day 5 into my project things started to progress.  With learn instruct videos on repeat, I slowly started to understand it all by reviewing the logic of other cli projects. Also, I had to review week's 3 and 4 lessons of OOR to help understand how to get the information from each of my classes.    My biggest hurdle was just creating my methods without a spec file giving me clues of what the method should return.  Furthermore, what created more frustration was getting my user input and pass that information into another method and display the results of the that input. For example, I initially  wanted my user to input a zip code and I wanted it to return the job information according to the zip code.  That was major fail.  The data from the API was only showing city and state so instead of having the user input their zip code, I based it around city and state.  I will say day 8 into my project concepts started to connect more.  

This project was very challenging and also very intimidating at first. There were several occasions I wanted to quit due to my  frustrations. It really showed many flaws and what subjects I needed to brush up on. With much help and guidance from my classmates, instructor, and resources, I was able to finish this project with more confidence than what I had when I first started.  Alot of the concepts I learned are so much clearer now.  I'm proud to say I built my first application and can't wait  to create more.
